x = 5
y = 10
x = y
print ("x = ", x)
print ("y - ", y)

'''
Suppose x = 5, y = 2
Addition:
x + y = 7
Subtraction:
x - y = 3
Multiplication:
x*y = 10
Division:
x/y = 2.5
Floor Division:
x//y = 2 (rounds down the answer to the nearest whole number)
Modulus:
x%y = 1 (gives the remainder when 5 is divided by 2)
Exponent:
x**y = 25 (5 to the power of 2)
