 # Extension Basis

 Destiny's Browser is a Chrome search browser visual overhaul.  By utilizing :root to set changeable colour variables to my CSS, HTML radio buttons, and JavaScript, the Destiny's Browser extension changes the background image, text colour, and stroke colour of the regular search page.  There are five different colour schemes to choose from: Tumbleweed, Old Blues, Lime Child, Rebel, and Lilac.  The user can alternate between the five themes easily without the need to refresh the browser.  Additionally, the extension can alter the URL position and appearence.
